# First time using the Arduino Uno R3
I had to know a little bit about circuits to understand better what I had to do and how should I do that

Let's start with a traffic light

## Materials:
- Arduino Uno R3 (01);
- Resistors (06);
- Button (01);
- Led (06), it looks better if it's red (02), green(02) and yellow(01);

## How does it work:
That's the first question to be able to code and make it work.
In this case you will see two different situations, the car traffic light and the pedestrians traffic light. Once you pull the button, the sistem will recieve the sign that someone wants to cross the street and it will turn the traffic for cars in red and the pedestrians in green.
After a while, the pedestrians traffic ligh will turn on and off repeatedly, to warn them that the light will turn red soon, and turn the cars one green.

## Code
`C++`
