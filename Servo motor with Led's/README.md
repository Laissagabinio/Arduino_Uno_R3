## Materials:
- Arduino Uno R3 (01);
- Resistors (02);
- Positional Micro servo (01);
- Led's (02);
- Bread board (01);

## How does it work:
There are two aditional things to understand here before being able to get to the circuit and code. As it says, the Servo motor is a motor and it has 0 and 180 as arguments to witch side it must turn. 
The conection between the motor and the Led is a "if", when the position of the server is over or less than x (any number you'd like to, if it's between 0 and 180) the Led will turn on or off. 

It's easier to understand after seeing it working on the TinkerCad https://www.tinkercad.com/things/jaq4lxyoD3V
