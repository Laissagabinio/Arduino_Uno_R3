## Materials:
- Arduino Uno R3 (01);
- Led's (07);
- Registors (07);
- Bread board (01);

## How does it work:
I wanted to turn the led's on and off, one by one, on the sequence it's been put on the bread board. After running all the seven led's in one direction, it has to go on the oposite direction, from the left to the right.
The ideia is that it looks like the led's are running towards and backwoards

## Code
`C++`
